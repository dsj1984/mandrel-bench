/**
 * Build the canonical close-validation gate list.
 *
 * Ordering (cheapest fast-fail first): typecheck → lint → [test] →
 * format → [coverage-capture] → check-baselines. The standalone `test`
 * gate is dropped when coverage-capture is the active test runner — i.e.
 * `crap.enabled === true` (Story #1798) AND a `test:coverage` script
 * exists (Story #4473) — because coverage-capture then carries
 * test-failure signalling under c8. When CRAP is on but `test:coverage` is
 * absent, coverage-capture is dropped and the `test` gate is restored so
 * there is always a working test gate.
 *
 * `typecheck` is mandatory; consumers may customise the command via
 * `project.commands.typecheck` (default `npm run typecheck`).
 *
 * Story #2210 retired the legacy per-kind in-process regression gates
 * (`check-maintainability`, `check-crap`, `check-mutation`) and their
 * shared in-process runner. The unified `check-baselines` gate is now the
 * single source of truth for per-kind regression enforcement
 * (attribution-wired floor + tolerance + schema).
 * The `epicBranch` parameter threads the close run's integration branch
 * into two gates: the `format` gate's `changedFileScope` (existing) and —
 * since Story #3890 — the `check-baselines` gate's `BASELINE_REF` env, so
 * the baselines regression compare diffs head against the epic integration
 * branch (`origin/<epicBranch>`) rather than the framework-default
 * `origin/main`. Without this, every child Story on an `epic/<id>` branch
 * re-discovered inherited main-vs-epic drift in untouched files as phantom
 * regressions and worked around it by hand-setting `BASELINE_REF`.
 *
 * Story #4473 — the coverage-capture gate spawns `npm run test:coverage`,
 * so it is registered ONLY when the consumer actually ships that script.
 * When CRAP is enabled but `test:coverage` is absent, coverage-capture is
 * dropped and the plain `test` gate is restored (see `buildTestGateEntry`),
 * so a consumer without a coverage script gets a working degraded test gate
 * instead of a deterministic close failure with no test gate at all. The
 * probe reads `package.json` at `cwd` (the gate execution directory).
 *
 * @param {{ config?: object, epicBranch?: string, cwd?: string, packageScripts?: Record<string, string> }} [opts]
 *   `config` is the canonical resolved config (`{ project, delivery, ... }`);
 *   gate commands resolve from `project.commands` and the CRAP toggle from
 *   `delivery.quality.gates.crap.enabled`. `epicBranch` is the close run's
 *   integration branch (`epic/<id>` for Epic-attached Stories, the base
 *   branch for standalone Stories). `cwd` is where the `package.json`
 *   coverage-script probe reads from (defaults to `process.cwd()`);
 *   `packageScripts` injects the scripts map directly (tests) and short-
 *   circuits the disk read.
